# Remy, a reMarkable tablet manager app

The goal of Remy is to allow simple interaction with the reMarkable tablet over ssh, without needing the cloud service, nor the USB Web UI.

Planned features:

- Browsing of contents on tablet
- Browsing of offline backups
- Preview of notebooks
- Customisable rendering of notebooks
- Manipulation of notebooks
    * layer management
    * template management
    * simplification of lines
- Offline customisable text conversion
- Integration with mathpix (they support stroke input!!!)
- Still to be understood: rendering of text/pdf as stroke data
